            <h2>Some quotes and works from Garry</h2>
            <p>There is nothing as mysterious as a fact clearly described I like to think of photographing as a two way
                act of respect. Respect for the medium, by letting it do what it does best, describe. And respect for
                the subject, by describing it as it is. A photograph must be responsible to both.</p>
            <p>I really try to divorce myself from any thought of possible use of this stuff. That’s part of the
                discipline. My only purpose while I’m working is to try to make interesting photographs, and what to do
                with them is another act – a alter consideration. Certainly while I’m working, I want them to be as
                useless as possible.
