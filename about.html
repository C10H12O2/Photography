    <p>Garry Winogrand ( January 14, 1928 – March 19, 1984) was an American street photographer, who
        portrayed U.S. life and its social issues in the mid-20th century. Photography curator, historian, and critic
        John Szarkowski called Winogrand the central photographer of his generation.</p>

        <p>He received three Guggenheim Fellowships to work on personal projects, a fellowship from the National
        Endowment for the Arts, and published four books during his lifetime. He was one of three photographers
        featured in the influential New Documents exhibition at Museum of Modern Art in New York in 1967 and had solo
        exhibitions there in 1969, 1977, and 1988. He supported himself by working as a freelance
        photojournalist and advertising photographer in the 1950s and 1960s, and taught photography in the 1970s. His
        photographs were featured in photography magazines including Popular Photography, Eros, Contemporary
        Photographer, and Photography Annual.</p>

        <p>Critic Sean O'Hagan wrote in 2014 that in "the 1960s and 70s, he defined street photography as an attitude as
        well as a style – and it has laboured in his shadow ever since, so definitive are his photographs of New
        York"; and in 2010 that though he photographed elsewhere, "Winogrand was essentially a New York photographer:
        frenetic, in-your-face, arty despite himself." Phil Coomes, writing for BBC News in 2013, said "For those of
        us interested in street photography there are a few names that stand out and one of those is Garry Winogrand,
        whose pictures of New York in the 1960s are a photographic lesson in every frame."</p>

        <p>In his lifetime, Winogrand published four monographs: The Animals (1969), Women are Beautiful (1975), Public
        Relations (1977) and Stock Photographs: The Fort Worth Fat Stock Show and Rodeo (1980). At the time of his
        death, his late work remained undeveloped, with about 2,500 rolls of undeveloped film, 6,500 rolls of developed
        but not proofed exposures, and about 3,000 rolls only realized as far as contact sheets being made.</p>
